I'm flexible, proactive, and curious. I believe in the craft of software engineering, but are pragmatic and are driven to make a positive change in the world. I love tackling challenges and I enjoy writing about it, I learned what it means to be a leader and a team player and thanks to that experience I am fueled with a desire to succeed and scale new heights and challenges to where my mindset is not : “can we do this?” But “what have we not scaled yet?”.
